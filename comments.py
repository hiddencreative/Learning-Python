# Comments in python.  As you may have notice this line starts with a hash sign (#).

# Hash signs are not processed by the python interpreter. You can use hash signs to create comments
# in your program to explain specific parts of the program, to creates notes, or to troubleshoot and/or
# test parts of the program.

# In the example below, the first line and third line will be printed, and the second line will be ignored.

print('This is the first line')
# print('This is the second line')
print('This is the third line')


# After running the program, remove the hash sign and run the program again.
